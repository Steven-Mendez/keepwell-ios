[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The app is available in English and Spanish and follows the device language; English is the
  source language in code and every screen, error, accessibility label, date and the Face ID
  prompt have a Spanish translation in `Localizable.xcstrings` catalogs.
- Tabs without movements say so and offer to log one instead of an empty screen.
- Create transaction: amount and type with the app's keypad, category, payment method, review (real
  bank debit, planned, shared, note) and a saved summary with the rate used and the new balance.
- Add card: credit cards (plastic, debt in one or two currencies, billing cycle), debit cards linked
  to a bank account, new bank accounts and wallets.
- Accounts: credit cards stacked like Wallet, deposit accounts with their linked cards, and cash
  with "Reconcile" and "ATM withdrawal".
- Onboarding: splash, welcome with restore from iCloud, currencies with a manual rate (default 1),
  accounts (bank, credit card, cash), privacy and reminders, and a summary when done.
- Project setup: XcodeGen, Debug/Staging/Release configurations, widgets extension, SwiftFormat,
  SwiftLint (with layer-boundary rules), Lefthook, GitHub Actions and Dependabot.
- Packages: `Core` (`AppRouter`, `CurrencyFormatter`), `DesignSystem` (tokens, Inter typography,
  `KWSurfaceCard`), `Domain` (shared kernel), `Persistence` (SwiftData + CloudKit, versioned schema)
  and `Features`.
- `AppContainer` composition root with init-based dependency injection.
- Data stays on the iPhone with SwiftData and is backed up to the private iCloud database while
  "iCloud backup" is on (default); turning it off keeps data on the device only.

### Fixed

- The app icon shows the keepwell mark on the brand gradient, as on the brand board, drawn flat
  (Icon Composer layers without glass) so iOS 26 doesn't add a halo around the mark.
