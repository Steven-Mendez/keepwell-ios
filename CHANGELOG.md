## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Accounts: credit cards stacked like Wallet, deposit accounts with their linked cards, and cash
  with "Cuadrar" and "Retiro de cajero".
- Onboarding: splash, welcome with restore from iCloud, currencies with a manual rate (default 1),
  accounts (bank, credit card, cash), privacy and reminders, and a summary when done.
- Project setup: XcodeGen, Debug/Staging/Release configurations, widgets extension, SwiftFormat,
  SwiftLint (with layer-boundary rules), Lefthook, GitHub Actions and Dependabot.
- Packages: `Core` (`AppRouter`, `CurrencyFormatter`), `DesignSystem` (tokens, Inter typography,
  `KWSurfaceCard`), `Domain` (shared kernel), `Persistence` (SwiftData + CloudKit, versioned schema)
  and `Features`.
- `AppContainer` composition root with init-based dependency injection.
- Data stays on the iPhone with SwiftData and is backed up to the private iCloud database while
  "Respaldo en iCloud" is on (default); turning it off keeps data on the device only.
